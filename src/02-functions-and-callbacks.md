# Functions & Callbacks

The core premis of function is writing code once and then reusing it again and again with different values / data.

## Generalized Functions

'Parameters' (_placeholders_) mean we don't need to decide what data to run our functionality on until we run the function. Then we can provide an acutal value (_argument_) when we run the function.

Higher order functions follow this same principle. We may not want to decide exactly what some of our functionality is until we run our function.

## Repeating Functionality

Overview of exection context when using a function that uses an array for an argument.

## Higher Order Functions

Often we write code that does somethiing, often to find out that we want to change it ever so slightly. Example looping over an array and multiplying the number or dividing it etc.
